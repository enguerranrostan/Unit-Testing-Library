# Unit Testing Library
ðŸ§ª A JS Unit Testing Library inspired by Jest

I created this library to deepen my understanding of unit testing & unit testing libraries. ðŸ¥° Thanks to the awesome people & resources that helped me along the way, mainly :

- [Afonso Pacifer](https://github.com/afonsopacifer) and his [article](https://blog.bitsrc.io/build-your-own-javascript-testing-framework-377e6583c870)
